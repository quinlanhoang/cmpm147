				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment is an auto tile generator in which you are presented with a dungeon and overworld that can be reseeded upon pressing the 'reseed' button. It accounts for rooms, passageways, bodies of water, chests and houses that are randomly generated and placed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The map is generated with the use of symbols such as "_, ., !, ?" that acts as placeholders and will loop over one another based on the depth of placement. It will then be given a pre-selected tile that may be randomly selected from an assortment of variations and will then be reiterated over from the tile set. Shapes and figures are not constricted and supplementary functions are utilized to create passageways, lakes, and bridges</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was rather challenging in terms of coding as reiterating auto tiling as well as translating from Glitch was rather difficult. This is something that I've personally never tried to do and was truly a learning experierence in terms of success as well as the rigors that I commonly faced.</p>
